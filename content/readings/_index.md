## ðŸ“š Books I've Read

Back in high school and college, I was an avid reader. But when COVID hit, my reading habit took a back seat. Counterintuitive, right? You'd think I'd have read more, not less. But that's how it went down.  
Fast forward to 2024, and I'm on a mission to get back into reading. Here's a quick look at where I stand now.
